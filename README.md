<h1>Simple Weather App in jQuery</h1>
<h2>Type in any zipcode in the world and get the weather in Fahrenheit. Click on the temperature to change to Celcius.</h2>
</h2>Works on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.</h2>

Virginia Beach weather is shown as default to prove initial Call to OpenWeatherMap API is working.
