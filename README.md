<h1>Simple Weather App in Jquery</h1>
<h2>Type in any zipcode in the world and get the weather in Fahrenheit. Click on temperature to change to Celcius.</h2>
</h2>Works on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.</h2>
</h3>For Internet Explorer, switch out "weatherjquery.js" for "weatherapp.js" in script tag at bottom of html page.</h3>

Virginia Beach weather is shown as default to prove initial Call to OpenWeatherMap API is working.

This includes both a jquery and a vanilla javascript script. Both do the same thing, but "weatherapp.js" will work in IE.
