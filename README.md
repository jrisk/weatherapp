Weather Web App
Type in any zipcode in the world and get the weather in Fahrenheit. Click to change to Celcius.
Virginia Beach weather is shown as default to prove initial Call to OpenWeatherMap API is working.
Works on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
For Internet Explorer, switch out "weatherjquery.js" for "weatherapp.js" in script tag at bottom of html page.

This includes both a jquery and a vanilla javascript script. Both do the same thing, but "weatherapp.js" will work in IE.
